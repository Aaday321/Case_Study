# Case_Study
This is a web application that consumes data from the Open Payments API and filters it for the user
It includes an export button to export the data to a spreedsheet
It also hits the database repeatedly to ensure it has the latest data (Currently that feature is set to wait for 
an extended period of time to avoid throttling from the API)
